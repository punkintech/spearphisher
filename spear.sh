##                   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
##                    Version 3, 29 June 2007
##
##    Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
##    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
##    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
##
##                         Preamble
##
##    The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
##    software and other kinds of works.
##
##    The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
##    to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
##    the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
##    share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
##    software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
##    GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
##    any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
##    your programs, too.
##
##    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
##    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
##    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
##    them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
##    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
##    free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
##
##    To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
##    these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
##    certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
##    you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
##
##    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
##    gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
##    freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
##    or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
##    know their rights.
##
##    Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
##    (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
##    giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
##
##    For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
##    that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
##    authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
##    changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
##    authors of previous versions.
##
##    Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
##    modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
##    can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
##    protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
##    pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
##    use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
##    have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
##    products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
##    stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
##    of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
##
##    Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
##    States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
##    software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
##    avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
##    make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
##    patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
##
##    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
##    modification follow.
